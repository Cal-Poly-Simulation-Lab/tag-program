# The PolySim Tag Program Curriculum Overview
The goal of the Cal Poly Simulation Laboratory (PolySim) is to build the skills of our membership and to recognize those members that develop new skills in modeling and simulation outside of the classroom.  Each tag level represents an advancement in the skills members gain toward gaining knowledge in modeling and simulation.  PolySim members are free to work through the belt activities in club meetings or on their own.  Once a badge activity has been completed, members should seek verification from the PolySim advisor or president.  At that time, members will receive a ‘remove before flight’ tag of the appropriate color.

## Tag Level 1 - Recruit
* Recruit – White – Basic Coding Proficiency
 *  Learn the basics of Git and Github
 * Demonstrate moderate proficiency in one language, Python
 * 
* Neo (Novice) – Orange – Advanced Coding Proficiency and Algorithms
o	Basics of Object Oriented programming
	Advanced Python Functions
	Python Modules
	Python Objects
•	Classes vs. Objects
•	Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
