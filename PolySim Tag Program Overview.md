# The PolySim Tag Program Curriculum Overview
The goal of the Cal Poly Simulation Laboratory (PolySim) is to build the skills of our membership and to recognize those members that develop new skills in modeling and simulation outside of the classroom.  Each tag level represents an advancement in the skills members gain toward gaining knowledge in modeling and simulation.  PolySim members are free to work through the belt activities in club meetings or on their own.  Once a badge activity has been completed, members should seek verification from the PolySim advisor or president.  At that time, members will receive a ‘remove before flight’ tag of the appropriate color.

## PolySim Recruit Level - Basics of Python and Simulation
The Cal Poly Simulation Laboratory (PolySim) is dedicated to working on projects involving modeling and simulation of aerospace systems.  One of our primary objectives is to support club members as they develop their own modeling, simulation, and controls skills.  Through the **PolySim Tag Program**, club members will start learning the tools of modeling, simulation, and control, including writing code and building hardware.

## Recruit Level Task List
To earn the White Tag, you will complete the following tasks:
- [ ] Task 0: Learn the basics of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Task 1: Learn some basic Python techniques such as:
  - Basic syntax, format, and variables
  - Logic and flow control to perform more complicated algorithms
  - Working with different data types
  - Basics of algorithms and functions
- [ ] Task 2: Explore the difference between different types of varialbe/data
- [ ] Task 3: Learn basic MatplotLib techniques to display static data
- [ ] Task 4: Learn basic VPython commands to create visualizations of dynamic data
- [ ] Task 5: Put all of these skills together to model and simulate the dynamics of a bouncing ball and the start of a plinko game.
